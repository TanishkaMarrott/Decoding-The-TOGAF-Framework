# Enterprise Continuum

--> Core concept within TOGAF. 

- Enterprise Continuum serves as :-  "A framework for categorising different architectural artifacts & solutions"
- Categorisation on the basis of :- Varying levels of abstraction / specialisation
  
What're  Key Elements?

1. Architecture Continuum
2. Solutions Continuum


Architecture Continuum is a collection of architectural building blocks (ABBs), the're reusable across different projects/ teams
While Solutions continuum comprises the collection of their actual implementations (SBBs or the tangibles). They're actual implementations of what's represented by the Architectural Continuum

> Architectural continuum represents a gradation / continuous refinement of architectural elements from generic to organisation-specific elements. While, the Solutions Continuum help us understand the advancement of implementations from generic solutions to specific implementations.

Layers:- Will remain identical for both of them

1 --> Foundational :-  More like a Universal Scaffolding --> basic, fundamental building blocks that form a base for more specific structures --> DBMS, OS, netwroking services

2 --> Common Systems:- Building blocks that're reusable across multiple systems/ organisations --> Could be some common security frameworks, or shared middleware services

3 --> Industry-specific:- Address concerns of a specific industry like HCLS, BFSI

4 --> Organisation-specific:- Custom-built applications, proprietary Business processes
