## TOGAF Overview

--> A well-structured framework for developing, managing & governing enterprise architecture.

</br>

## How is TOGAF different from other Project Management Frameworks?

</br>

> Okay, so the TOGAF framework is disticnt from the Project Management farmeworks, yet they're complementary from an organisationa; standpoint .

</br>

The Scope  + The Strategic Alignment Aspects 

The scope and focus areas are different, With TOGAF , my prime focus is Enterprise Architecture, ensuring my tech is aligned with business *always*. Tech without Business alignment is similar to a train without an engine, we need some core business goals in place, before setting up our technology solutions.
It's more around designing, planning, implementing , governing EA.

While PM frameworks, are more geared towards the typical lifecycle processes centred around the delivery of projects, Initiation, Planning, monitoring, controlling, closing a project ---> within the scope, within timelines, within the budget, ensuring appropraite quality standards and timeliness

The framework components too are different --> ADM, Enterprise Continuum. We'll discuss these subsequently, as we dive deeper. 

Also, TOGAF's outputs describe various aspects of an architecture, like artifacts, building blocks, views, while typical PM frameworks' outputs are centred around project-documents

</br>

> Summarising this real quick:- TOGAF is for long-term strategic planning, and IT alignment with the business. PM Frameworks deal with the "tactical" elements of Individual Project Executions.

### Key Objectives we're looking at:-

 - TOGAF aligns IT strategy with business goals.

- It improves process efficiency and optimizes resource usage.
  
- Establishes a common foundational understanding for tech and non-tech stakeholders.
  
-  Sets governance structures to oversee implementations and ensure regulatory compliance.
  
-  Can be adapted to specific organizational needs.
  
- Ensures well-managed plans and roadmaps for transitions.
  
- Evaluates the risk associated with IT investments, assessing feasibility and guiding decision-making.

## Four Main Domains within EA as defined by TOGAF

### 1 --> Business Architecture:-

Purpose:- Aligning business processes and structures with the overarching strategic goals

- Components:-
  Business processes, Org Structure, KPIs and Goals üìå

- My Personal Insights :-
   It's absolutely important that all of our critical business process *are in sync* with the Strategic objectives. Strategy should drive Technology, not vice-versa

</br>

### 2 --> Data Architecture:-

Purpose:- Describes our model --> For managing data and assets, we're striving to ensure it's accessible, clean and accurate

- Components:- Data Models, Flow diagrams, Governance policies, Data storage and retrieval systems
  
- My Personal Insights :- You need to have some solid Data Governance policies, plus an efficient Data Management and Utilisation. This would make sure we've got the correct "Drivers" for Strategic Planning and Decision-Making üëç

</br>

### 3 --> Application Architecture:-

Purpose:- Provides a blueprint for *individual* application systems; how they'd be deployed; integrations / interoperability --> Their relationships with Core Business Processes

- Components:- Application components, their interfaces, services
  
- My Personal Insights:- We need to design application architectures, that're not only meeting the current business requirements, but are also "scalable" to cater to future growth. This means a very "smooth integration/ interoperability"

</br>

### 4 --> Technology Architecture:-

Purpose:- This revolves around defining the infrastructure that would be needed to sustain/ support the applications we deploy.

 - Components:- Software, servers, hardware, networking
   
 - My personal Insights:- The way we've ensured smooth integration of applications to propel future growth, there must be a solid, robust infrastructure to not only support present-day demands, but *scale up* without becoming a bottleneck. Means it should have the right mix of components:- servers, networking aspects, software, in a way that its resilient to support critical functions
