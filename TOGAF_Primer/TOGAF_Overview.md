# Quick Overview of TOGAF

TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework): It's actually a comprehensive framework for developing, managing plus governing enterprise architecture.

## How is TOGAF different from other Project Management Frameworks?
Okay, so the TOGAF framework is disticnt from the Project Management farmeworks, yet they're complementary from an organisationa; standpoint .

The Scope  + The Strategic Alignment Aspects 

The scope and focus areas are different, With TOGAF , my prime focus is Enterprise Architecture, ensuring my tech is aligned with business *always*. Tech without Business alignment is similar to a train without an engine, we need some core business goals in place, before setting up our technology solutions.
It's more around designing, planning, implementing , governing EA.

While PM frameworks, are more geared towards the typical lifecycle processes centred around the delivery of projects, Initiation, Planning, monitoring, controlling, closing a project ---> within the scope, within timelines, within the budget, ensuring appropraite quality standards and timeliness

> So TOGAF is something around the "overarching" Enterprise Architecture.

The framework components too are different --> ADM, Enterprise Continuum. We'll discuss these subsequently, as we dive deeper. 

Also, TOGAF's outputs describe various aspects of an architecture, like artifacts, building blocks, views, while typical PM frameworks' outputs are centred around project-documents

Summarising this real quick:- TOGAF is for long-term strategic planning, and IT alignment with the business. PM Frameworks deal with the "tactical" elements of Individual Project Executions.



### Key Objectives we're looking at:-

 - TOGAF aligns IT strategy with business goals.

- It improves process efficiency and optimizes resource usage.
  
- Establishes a common foundational understanding for tech and non-tech stakeholders.
  
-  Sets governance structures to oversee implementations and ensure regulatory compliance.
  
-  Can be adapted to specific organizational needs.
  
- Ensures well-managed plans and roadmaps for transitions.
  
- Evaluates the risk associated with IT investments, assessing feasibility and guiding decision-making.
