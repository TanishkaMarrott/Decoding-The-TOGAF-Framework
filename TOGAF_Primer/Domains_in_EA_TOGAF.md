## Four Main Domains within EA as defined by TOGAF

</br>

### 1 --> Business Architecture:-

Purpose:- Aligning business processes and structures with the overarching strategic goals

- Components:-
  Business processes, Org Structure, KPIs and Goals üìå

- My Personal Insights :-
   It's absolutely important that all of our critical business process *are in sync* with the Strategic objectives. Strategy should drive Technology, not vice-versa

</br>

### 2 --> Data Architecture:-

Purpose:- Describes our model --> For managing data and assets, we're striving to ensure it's accessible, clean and accurate

- Components:- Data Models, Flow diagrams, Governance policies, Data storage and retrieval systems
  
- My Personal Insights :- You need to have some solid Data Governance policies, plus an efficient Data Management and Utilisation. This would make sure we've got the correct "Drivers" for Strategic Planning and Decision-Making üëç

</br>

### 3 --> Application Architecture:-

Purpose:- Provides a blueprint for *individual* application systems; how they'd be deployed; integrations / interoperability --> Their relationships with Core Business Processes

- Components:- Application components, their interfaces, services
  
- My Personal Insights:- We need to design application architectures, that're not only meeting the current business requirements, but are also "scalable" to cater to future growth. This means a very "smooth integration/ interoperability"

</br>

### 4 --> Technology Architecture:-

Purpose:- This revolves around defining the infrastructure that would be needed to sustain/ support the applications we deploy.

 - Components:- Software, servers, hardware, networking
   
 - My personal Insights:- The way we've ensured smooth integration of applications to propel future growth, there must be a solid, robust infrastructure to not only support present-day demands, but *scale up* without becoming a bottleneck. Means it should have the right mix of components:- servers, networking aspects, software, in a way that its resilient to support critical functions
