# The Archietcture Content Framework

Okay, so the Architecture Content Framework provides a structure to organise / manage the artifacts produced as a part of the architecture development process. 

> It could be Building Blocks, deliverables, artifacts, governance structures that're necessary for us to develop, manage and communicate EA effectively. 👍

Key Components of the TOGAF Content Framework
- Architecture Building Blocks or ABBs
- Solution Building Blocks - SBBs
- Deliverables
- Artifacts
- Governance

Architecture Building Blocks is more of an abstract concept, They're high-level components that describe certain aspects of an architecture. They're the foundational elements of an architecture, describing certain functionality that the architecture would offer, (It's intangible, high-level, and is not tied to a specific technology). They're reusable and can be used across different projects/ architectures, and are aligned with industry/ organisationsal standards

Solution Building blocks are the tangibles, they represent the abstract ABBs in a tangible, concrete form. So, they're the actual implementations, created at the time of Architecture Realisation. They're associated with specific platforms/ technologies. They include the detailed specifics (deployed and maintained as a part of teh Architecture)

> ABBs describe the functionality (Intangible.) SBBs actually implement the functioanlity, they're tangible components / concrete components, as a part of the Architectural realisation. --> they're implementing the functionality described by the SBBs
