# The Archietcture Content Framework

Okay, so the Architecture Content Framework provides a structure to organise / manage the artifacts produced as a part of the architecture development process. 

> It could be Building Blocks, deliverables, artifacts, governance structures that're necessary for us to develop, manage and communicate EA effectively. 👍

Key Components of the TOGAF Content Framework
- Architecture Building Blocks or ABBs
- Solution Building Blocks - SBBs
- Deliverables
- Artifacts
- Governance

--> Architecture Building Blocks is more of an abstract concept,     
They're high-level components that describe certain aspects of an architecture. 

They're the foundational elements of an architecture, describing certain functionality that the architecture would offer, (It's intangible, high-level, and is not tied to a specific technology). They're reusable and can be used across different projects/ architectures, and are aligned with industry/ organisationsal standards

--> Solution Building blocks are the tangibles, they represent the abstract ABBs in a tangible, concrete form. So, they're the actual implementations, created at the time of Architecture Realisation. 
They're associated with specific platforms/ technologies. They include the detailed specifics (deployed and maintained as a part of the Architecture)

> ABBs describe the functionality (Intangibles) SBBs actually implement the functionality, they're tangible components / concrete components, as a part of the Architectural realisation. --> they're implementing the functionality described by the SBBs

--> Deliverables:- They're the outputs, the models, documents that're produced as a part of the Architecture development Process. They're they "key" factors in driving communication, governance and decision making.
 - Architecture Vision:- High-level overview, describes the desired target state
 - Architecture Definition Document :- Detailed Specifics including the models & mapping
 - Transition Architecture:- Intermediate stages, They guide from teh current state to the target state

--> Artifacts:- Architectural atrifacts are like individual pieces of information, that describe an architecture from different perspectives.
they're used to create deliverables, and could be in various frmats, matrices, catalogs, diagrams or even narratives

--> Architecture Governance:- Framework and processes that'll ensure the architecture is developed, managed and controlled, in a consistent manner

> It's more around establishing roles, policies, responsibilities, procedures to guide, and monitor arch. activities

   - Architecture Board :- Oversees the implementation of the architecture, and ensures it's alignment with the business objectives
   - Compliance Reviews :- The Board would assess if the architectural practices conform with the standards/ guidelines, that've been defined in the preliminary phase
   - Change control - AMnaging plus approving changes to the architecture


### What exactly is the differnce between an artifact and a deliverable?

Artifact is an individual, detailes pience of information, represnting a specific view of the architecture. It could be a catalog, list, diagram, or a matrix.
They're more granular

> An artifact is more *raw* than a deliverable. A deliverable is a more comprehensive, *purpose-driven* document. It's formally reviewed, contractually specified. And it needs to have a purpose, --> defining requirements, defining vision, 

Deliverable actually *encapsulates* a variety of artifacts. It's more structured and well-laid out
Examples include:-
- Architecture Roadmap
- Architecture Vision
- Architecture Definition Doument (This could include the Application Portfolio Catalog and a variety of other artifacts)
- Transition Architecture

These are the crucial for driving governance, decision making, and stakeholder management

### So, what was the significance of the content framework?
