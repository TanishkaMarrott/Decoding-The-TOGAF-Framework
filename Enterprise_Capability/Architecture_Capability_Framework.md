# Enterprise Capability - The Architecture capability framework

> So, what exactly is the Architecture Capability Framework? It's the ability to develop, manage, use and maintain architecture within an enterprise,
>this refers to the organisational structure, the roles, responsibilities, and how does it fit in within an enterprise, while aligning with the overarching objectives of the organisation

It's more around establishing "capability" within the enterprise, This framework will help us ensure that architecture practice within an irganisation is well-managed, defined and aligned with the org's business goals

--> Key Aspects within this Framework

- Organizational Structure:- By Organisational Structure, I'm referring to the arrangement of roles, responsibilities and their relationships within an organization, to support what we call "architecture practice"

   - Architecture Team : The group that actually develops and maintains EA
   - Architecture Board : The governing body, that oversees the implementation of the architecture practice, and if it aligns with the business requirements.
   - Stakeholders:- That could refer to End-Users, Business Leaders, and Managers

- Roles and Responsibilities:-

- Processes

- Tools and Techniques

- Governance:-
    - We discussed this before. This is more around oversight of the implementation. This means it ensures that the practice operates effectively and ensures alignment with business strategy,
    - Plus, it would check for conformance/ compliance with regulatory standards
    - Managing , approving for changes to Enterprise Architecture.
    - So, two additional responsibilities :- COmpliance Reviews plus Change Control
  
- Skills and Competencies
