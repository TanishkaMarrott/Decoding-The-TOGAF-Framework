# Enterprise Capability - The Architecture capability framework

> So, what exactly is the Architecture Capability Framework? It's the ability to develop, manage, use and maintain architecture within an enterprise,
>this refers to the organisational structure, the roles, responsibilities, and how does it fit in within an enterprise, while aligning with the overarching objectives of the organisation

It's more around establishing "capability" within the enterprise, This framework will help us ensure that architecture practice within an irganisation is well-managed, defined and aligned with the org's business goals

--> Key Aspects within this Framework

- Organizational Structure:- By Organisational Structure, I'm referring to the arrangement of roles, responsibilities and their relationships within an organization, to support what we call "architecture practice"

   - Architecture Team : The group that actually develops and maintains EA
   - Architecture Board : The governing body, that oversees the implementation of the architecture practice, and if it aligns with the business requirements.
   - Stakeholders:- That could refer to End-Users, Business Leaders, and Managers

- Roles and Responsibilities:- Would typically be in a hierarchical format:-

   - Chief Architect: Leads the architecture vision, (His primary responsibilities ae stakeholder management, governance & strategic leadership)

   - Enterprise architect :- Conducting gap analysis, defining roadmaps, defining architecture models
     
   - Domain architect --> Handles domain-specific architectures --> ensuring integration and inter-operability

   - Solution Architect --> Designs project -specific solutions. He ensures compliance with EA

- Processes
  - ADM :- The Architectural Development Model, Heart of TOGAF, Iterative model for designing, planning, implementing and Governing Enterprise Architecture
  - Architecture governance :- More around oversight of the implementation, ensuring the architecture practice conforms with architecture standards,  plus alignment with the business goals 
  - Stakeholder management , A very typical process --> involves managing the stakeholders, addressing their concerns, communicating plans plus ensuring their buy-in

- Tools and Techniques:-

  Since TOGAF is a structured framework, it provides us with a variety of tools and techniques that "facilitate" the development, management and documentation of architecture:-
     - Architecture Modelling tools --> Creating models and diagrams
     - Repository tools --> Storing and managing architectural artifacts
     - Collaboration tools --> Something like Confluence, for communication within the architecture team, and with the stakeholders

       
- Governance:-
    - We discussed this before. This is more around oversight of the implementation. This means it ensures that the practice operates effectively and ensures alignment with business strategy,
    - Plus, it would check for conformance/ compliance with regulatory standards
    - Managing , approving for changes to Enterprise Architecture.
    - So, two additional responsibilities :- Compliance Reviews plus Change Control
  
- Skills and Competencies

  - Architecture Skills frameworks outlines the skills/ competencies needed for a successful delivery of projects, So , this includes, identifying potential for upskilling/ development/ training  needed for a capable architecture team,    

  - This could either be :-
        - Analytical/ technical/ Communication skills               
        - Or could be some specialised skills:-            
              - understanding business processes/ goals/ strategies            
              - Defining data models, understanding data governence, management of data         
              - Design/ Integration of Applications            
              - Or could be proficiency in the Infrastructure Side of things (Technology Architecture)
