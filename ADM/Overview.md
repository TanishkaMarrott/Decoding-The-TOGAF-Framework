 ## ADM - "The Heart of TOGAF"

Stands for Architectural Development Method

--> ADM gives us a structured, step-by-step approach to develop & manage enterprise architecture.

</br>

> ADM is an iterative model / a cycle. We revisit and refine the architecture in each cycle, This means we're adaptable to dynamic business scanerios.
>
> -->It provides us with a "holistic" methodology for designing, planning, implementing & governing EA. üëç

</br>

ADM comprises 8 phases:-

**--> Preliminary Phase:-**

- We're establishing the architecture framework and principles 
- Setting up governance structures ( would oversee if the architectural implementation conforms with the business)
- Plus, setting up the organisation (The Capability Part:- Organisational structure, roles & responsibilities) needed to deliver successful projects

</br>

> What exactly are we doing here?
>
> We're laying the groundwork for our architecture project
> Once we've defined the principles, the frameworks, the scope, we've actually "laid" the foundation or set the stage for subsequent phases of the project. We're ensuring that the organisation is actually ready for the architecture development phase

</br>

**--> Phase A - Architecture Vision:-** 

- Define the high-level architectural vision
- Request for Architecture Work issued by the sponsors
- Seeking Approval from stakeholders

</br>

> What does this mean?
>
> We're outlining the high-level vision for the architecture, This vision should align with the business goals. This provides "clear drection" for us to proceed with the later phases of the architecture. During this phase, the sponsors issue "Request of Architecture Work" -- to formally initate the process of architectural development. Also, stakeholder buy-in and support --> their approval is sought to ensure we've got the support of relevant parties

</br>

**--> Phase B - Business Architecture:-** 

Aligning the business processes with the strategic goals we're looking at

Phase C :- Information Systems Architecture:- Comprises the Data and Application Architecture part, 1--> An efficient data management and governance part plus ensuring the application deployment, integrations is in lines with the business objectives

Phase D :- Technology Architecture:- Robust infrastructure to support all of our processes --> the servers, networking , hardware to "sustain" our architectures

Phase E :- Opportunites and Solutions:- Evaluate and assess risks associated with the IT investments

Phase F :- Migration Planning:- Create and design detailed plans with regards to the implementation and migration

Phase G :- Implementation Governance:- Govern/ Oversee the implementation, check if it conforms with the regulatory standards

Phase H :- Change Management:- Chnage management must be smooth, well-managed with appropriate roadmaps, such that we're evolving with dynamically changing business requirements.

- Requirements Management would be an ongoing process throughout the cycle
