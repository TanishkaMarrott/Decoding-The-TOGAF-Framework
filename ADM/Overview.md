 ## ADM - "The Heart of TOGAF"

Stands for Architectural Development Method

--> ADM gives us a structured, step-by-step approach to develop & manage enterprise architecture.

</br>

> ADM is an iterative model / a cycle. We revisit and refine the architecture in each cycle, This means we're adaptable to dynamic business scanerios.
>
> -->It provides us with a "holistic" methodology for designing, planning, implementing & governing EA. üëç

</br>

ADM comprises 8 phases:-

**--> Preliminary Phase:-**

- We're establishing the architecture framework and principles 
- Setting up governance structures ( would oversee if the architectural implementation conforms with the business)
- Plus, setting up the organisation (The Capability Part:- Organisational structure, roles & responsibilities) needed to deliver successful projects

</br>

> What exactly are we doing here?
>
> We're laying the groundwork for our architecture project
> Once we've defined the principles, the frameworks, the scope, we've actually "laid" the foundation or set the stage for subsequent phases of the project. We're ensuring that the organisation is actually ready for the architecture development phase

</br>

**--> Phase A - Architecture Vision:-** 

- Define the high-level architectural vision
- Request for Architecture Work issued by the sponsors
- Seeking Approval from stakeholders

</br>

> What does this mean?
>
> We're outlining the high-level vision for the architecture, This vision should align with the business goals. This provides "clear drection" for us to proceed with the later phases of the architecture. During this phase, the sponsors issue "Request of Architecture Work" -- to formally initate the process of architectural development. Also, stakeholder buy-in and support --> their approval is sought to ensure we've got the support of relevant parties

</br>

**--> Phase B - Business Architecture:-** 

We're defining the operations in an organisation, while focusing on --> Business processes, org structure, roles and "capabilities"

</br>

> I'll breakdown the jargons we've used -->
> 
> Business Processes :- Core activities that produce "value" for the organisation. They define how tasks are carried out to achieve business goals.
>
> Org. Structure :- Hierarchy and Relationships between departments, teams etc
>
> Capabilities:- Abilities slash competencies required to deliver successful projects
>
> KPIs :- These are the metrics to measure the performance - to "quantify" the success of business activities

</br>

> For those who're new to the business terminology:-
> 
> What exactly is the difference between business processes, goals and objectives?
>
> By business processes, we mean the "activities" performed to produce value --> drive the organisation towards a streamlined business growth. Business goals, on the other hand, refer to the "aims" that an organisation strives to achieve; and this _guides_ an organisation's activities & priorities üëç

</br>

Key Activities that're a part of Phase B :-

1 --> Developing a Baseline Business Architecture:- 

We're evaluating/ assessing the current business processes, org structure, roles and capabilities. Plus, getting it documented, (It'll serve as a baseline or reference point for comparison with the target architecture)

2 --> Defining a Target Business Architecture:- 

We'll then establish a vision for the desired future state of the Business Architecture; and identify the capabilities/ competencies needed to achieve it

3 --> Gap Analysis :- 

Identifying the gaps/ inefficiences in the current Business Architecture, analysing the differences. Also, determining which gaps need to be addressed on priority

4 --> Having a detailed implementation plan/ action plan laid out:-

</br>

> This means having a detailed roadmap in place to move from the Current Architecture to the Desired/ Target Architecture. Making sure we're aligning the business architecture with the Data, Application and Technology Architecture.
>
> Plus, sharing the business architecture plan with the Stakeholders for a "clear communication"

</br>


**--> Phase C - Information Systems Architecture:-** 

- Comprises both Data and Application Architecture aspects, sequence doesn't matter through

</br>

> Flow of activities in the BDAT phases, is pretty much predictable.
>
> We'd first start with defining the baseline architecture; Then, develop the target architectures. Perform a gap analysis, to analyse the differences between the reference and target architectures. And accordingly, we'd build out a detailed implementation plan - a roadmap to provide strategic direction to the activities plus setting their priorities. These need to be in lines with the "overarching" objectives of the organisation.
> 
> Plus, incorporate some stakeholder management - communicating the plans to ensure their needs are catered to
> Documentation, for a crystal-clear documentation

</br>

Data Architecture:-

Focus :- Describing the Data Model, Emphasis is on Data Management & Governance here- ensuring it supports and aligns well with the overall business and IT infrastructure.

</br>

> üí° Intent is to ensure the quality, security and accessibility of Data --> This means having strong & robust Data Governance Policies and procedures to control the flow of data

<.br>

Key Activities that encompass this phase:-

1 --> Define what we call a "Baseline Architecture", That's through analysing the current state of data --> the data sources, structure, models & flow of data

2 --> Develop the vision of the target data architecture - We'd be developing physical and logical data models, have some data flow diagrams created 

3 --> Identify gaps, from a data standpoint,  prioritise changes considering 1 --> Feasibility of changes, and 2 --> Impact on the business

4 --> We'd then have to involve relevant stakeholders within the data domain, keeping them informed, seeking their fromal approval (We need to ensure senior leadership buy-in and support at every stage...)

5 --> Data Governance, The core of this, We need to define and implement Data Governance Policies, --> procedures around data quality, consistency and security

6 --> And Best practices, around 

Phase D :- Technology Architecture:- Robust infrastructure to support all of our processes --> the servers, networking , hardware to "sustain" our architectures

Phase E :- Opportunites and Solutions:- Evaluate and assess risks associated with the IT investments

Phase F :- Migration Planning:- Create and design detailed plans with regards to the implementation and migration

Phase G :- Implementation Governance:- Govern/ Oversee the implementation, check if it conforms with the regulatory standards

Phase H :- Change Management:- Chnage management must be smooth, well-managed with appropriate roadmaps, such that we're evolving with dynamically changing business requirements.

- Requirements Management would be an ongoing process throughout the cycle
