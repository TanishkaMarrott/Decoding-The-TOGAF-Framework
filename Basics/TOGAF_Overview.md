## Quick Overview on TOGAF

--> It's a well-structured framework for developing, managing plus governing Enterprise Architecture.

</br>

### How does TOGAF differ from other PM Frameworks?

I'd like to add a small note here:- TOGAF and PM Frameworks are distinct yet they're complementary from an organisational standpoint.

</br>


--> The scope and radars are different.

With TOGAF, our prime focus revolves around developing, implementing and governing Enterprise Architecture

PM Frameworks, on the other hand, are geared towards "typical lifecycle processes centred around delivery of projects"

</br>

> Initiation, planning, monitoring, controlling & closing a project ---> within the scope, the proposed timelines, the budget that's been sanctioned.
Ensuring we're delivering quality within the said timelines. That's what PM is all about.

</br>

TOGAF is something around the "overarching" Enterprise Architecture...

--> Not to mention, the framework components too differ. More on this subsequently, as we dive deeper. 

--> TOGAF's outputs represent various aspects of an architecture --> comprise "re-usable building blocks" across projects, artifacts, deliverables, views, while typical PM frameworks'have around project-related documents as their outputs.

</br>

I'll summarise this real quick:-

***TOGAF is for long-term strategic planning and IT alignment with the business. PM Frameworks deal with the "tactical" elements --> the individual project executions.***
