## Quick Overview on TOGAF

--> It's a well-structured framework for developing, managing plus governing Enterprise Architecture.

</br>

### How does TOGAF differ from other PM Frameworks?

I'd like to add a small note here:- TOGAF and PM Frameworks are distinct yet they're complementary from an organisational standpoint.

</br>


--> The scope and radars are different.

With TOGAF, our prime focus revolves around developing, implementing and governing Enterprise Architecture

PM Frameworks, on the other hand, are geared towards "typical lifecycle processes centred around delivery of projects"

</br>

> Initiation, planning, monitoring, controlling & closing a project ---> within the scope, the proposed timelines, the budget that's been sanctioned.
Ensuring we're delivering quality within the said timelines. That's what PM is all about.

</br>

TOGAF is something around the "overarching" Enterprise Architecture...

--> Not to mention, the framework components too differ. More on this subsequently, as we dive deeper. 

Also, TOGAF's outputs describe various aspects of an architecture, like artifacts, building blocks, views, while typical PM frameworks' outputs are centred around project-documents

Summarising this real quick:- TOGAF is for long-term strategic planning, and IT alignment with the business. PM Frameworks deal with the "tactical" elements of Individual Project Executions.



### Key Objectives we're looking at:-

 - TOGAF aligns IT strategy with business goals.

- It improves process efficiency and optimizes resource usage.
  
- Establishes a common foundational understanding for tech and non-tech stakeholders.
  
-  Sets governance structures to oversee implementations and ensure regulatory compliance.
  
-  Can be adapted to specific organizational needs.
  
- Ensures well-managed plans and roadmaps for transitions.
  
- Evaluates the risk associated with IT investments, assessing feasibility and guiding decision-making.
