# Decoding the TOGAF Framework

I've dedicated this repository towards chronicling my entire journey into Enterprise Architecture - Specifically, the TOGAF Framework

--> Here, I document my learning, share some insights I find worth-while,  more so from a practical standpoint. 
--> Plus, reflect on the concepts I feel are integral to mastering TOGAF. 

Your insights and additions are most welcome! :)



## Setting the stage

</br>

> I feel it's crucial to first understand what we mean by Enterprise Architecture. 

</br>

Enterprise, by itself, means a collection of organisations with some shared objectives. They might be diverse, yet they've got "some shared, unified goals"

There come's the second term :- Architecture. It's a structure of components and their inter-relationships. Plus, the principles and guidelines that'll govern the design/evolution of our architectures

</br>

## Why did I focus on Enterprise Architecture?

EA is a very well-laid-out framework for aligning business goals and core processes with its tech infrastructure. 

It incorporates coherence and efficiency into workflows, which is "super-critical for decision-making", and planning from a strategic standpoint.

Why? 

Because it takes you all the way from designing, planning, implementing -- and governing enterprise analysis to support the business... (Governance is absolutely crucial here)

</br>

> At the end of the day, it's about aligning technology with core business objectives. EA serves like a "holistic approach". We're not only maximising on our productivity metrics, but also becoming "adaptable" --> That's something much needed when you're trying to thrive in a evolving market üëç

</br>

Now that we're through with the intro, let's dive deeper into individual sections :)

## Quick Disclaimer

I've captured and penned down these notes during my preparation for the TOGAF 10 EA Foundation Exam. And intend to reflect my personal understanding & learnings. This is NOt meant to serve as a definitive source of information :)
