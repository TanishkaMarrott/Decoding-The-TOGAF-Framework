   # TOGAF Learning Repository

   Hello there!

   This is Tanishka, and a warm welcome to my TOGAF Learning repository! I've dedicated this repository towards documenting my learning journey & understanding the nuances of TOGAF - how it *actually* helps ensure we're aligning technical infra with the business goals.

   
   Here, you'll find some notes, summaries, all things related to TOGAF.

   ## How I've structured it:-

   - **Basics**: Some basic introduction to TOGAF, key objectives plus fundamental concepts
   - **ADM**: Detailed breakdown of the Architecture Development Method (ADM) phases.
   - **Enterprise Continuum**: Information on the Enterprise Continuum and Architecture Repository.
   - **Case Studies**: Practical examples and case studies related to TOGAF implementation.
   - **Resources**: Books, articles, and websites for further reading and reference.

   ## How could you get started?

   If you'd like to learn with me, simply navigate through the directories, pull out some Markdown files - topics you'd like to learn. As always, open to suggestions & improvisations. Please feel free to connect at tanishka.marrott@gmail.com

   Happy Learning!
