   # TOGAF Learning Repository

   Hello there!

   This is Tanishka, and a very warm welcome to my TOGAF Learning repository! 
   
   I've dedicated this repository towards documenting my entire learning journey, as I dive into & grasp the nuances of TOGAF --> how it'll help ensure that we're *actually* aligning technical infrastructure with the business goals.

   Here, you'll find some notes, summaries, all things related to TOGAF...

   ## How I've structured it:-

   - **Basics**: Fundamental Concepts plus TOGAF Key Objectives
   - **ADM**: Deep-dive into Architecture Development Method plus its phases
   - **Enterprise Continuum** Plus the Architecture Repository
   - **Case Studies**: Practical examples and case studies on implementing TOGAF
   - **Resources**:  Books, articles and websites I feel would be worthwhile for further reading and reference.

   ## How could you get started?

   If you'd like to learn with me, simply navigate through the directories, pull out some Markdown files - topics you'd like to learn. As always, open to suggestions & improvisations. Please feel free to connect at tanishka.marrott@gmail.com

   Happy Learning!
