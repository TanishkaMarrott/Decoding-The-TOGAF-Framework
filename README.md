# Decoding the TOGAF Framework

This repository is dedicated towards chronicling my entire journey into Enterprise Architecture, more so TOGAF. 

Here, I document my learning, share some insights I find worth-while,  from a practical standpoint. 
--> Plus, reflect on the concepts I feel are integral to mastering TOGAF. 

Feel free to explore and contribute to this evolving repository :)


## Setting the stage

</br>

> I feel it's crucial to first understand what exactly do we mean by Enterprise Architecture

</br>

--> An enterprise is a collection of Organisations with some Shared Objectives, They have diverse functions, yet *some shared, unified goals*

--> There come's the next term, Architecture.  It's a structure of components, their inter-relationships, the principles and guidelines that'll govern the design/evolution of our architectures

</br>

> TOGAF - isn't a monolithic manual, it's something more structured and phased out... this means it could either be used like a scaffolding, or maybe something that's pretty much tailored to your organisation's specific needs

</br>

This means it comprises fundamental concepts (ADM, Enterprise continuum) (More on this subsequently) , to tools, frameworks, best practices , proven methodologies that have been trialed and tested . 

And why Enterprise Architecture? It provides us with a structured framework to manage complexities;      
Streamline operations and processes, maybe analyse and manage risks. Resource management or Stakeholder communication. 

</br>

> At the end of the day, it's about ensuring we're strategically aligning our technology with business objectives.

</br>

Now that we're through with the intro, let's dive deeper into individual sections :)
