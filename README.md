# Decoding the TOGAF Framework

This repository is dedicated towards chronicling my entire journey into Enterprise Architecture, more so TOGAF. 

Here, I document my learning, share some insights I find worth-while,  from a practical standpoint. 
--> Plus, reflect on the concepts I feel are integral to mastering TOGAF. 

Feel free to explore and contribute to this evolving repository :)

## Setting the stage

</br>

> I feel it's crucial to first understand what exactly do we mean by Enterprise Architecture

</br>

--> An enterprise is a collection of Organisations with some Shared Objectives, They have diverse functions, yet *some shared, unified goals*

--> There come's the next term, Architecture.  It's a structure of components, their inter-relationships, the principles and guidelines that'll govern the design/evolution of our architectures

</br>

> TOGAF - isn't a monolithic manual, it's something more structured and phased out... this means it could either be used like a scaffolding, or maybe something that's pretty much tailored to your organisation's specific needs

</br>

This means it comprises fundamental concepts (ADM, Enterprise continuum) (More on this subsequently) , to tools, frameworks, best practices , proven methodologies that have actually been tried and tested . 

</br>

## Why Focus on Enterprise Architecture?

I feel it's a comprehensive and a "structured" framework for aligning IT strategy with business goals. EA allows for a *holistic* view of the entire Organisation's processes, systems and tech infrastructure. 

--> This is *critical towards decision-making and "strategic" planning*. It optimises on my current operational workflows, but also helps incorporate new technologies, such that my organisation stays agile to evolving requirements.  This means a clear roadmap for future growth tooüëç


</br>

> At the end of the day, it's about ensuring we're strategically aligning our technology with business objectives.

Now that we're through with the intro, let's dive deeper into individual sections :)


## Quick Disclaimer

I've captured and penned down these notes during my preparation for TOGAF 10 Foundation Exam. And intend to reflect my personal understanding & learnings. This is NOt meant to serve as a definitive source of information :)
