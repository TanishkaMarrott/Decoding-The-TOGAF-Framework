# Decoding the TOGAF Framework

This repository is dedicated to chronicling my entire journey into Enterprise Architecture, specifically TOGAF. 

Here, I document my learning process, share some insights I find worth-while, more so from a practical standpoint plus reflect on the concepts I feel are integral to mastering TOGAF. 

Feel free to explore and contribute to this evolving repository.


## Setting the stage

Before exploring TOGAF, it's crucial that we gain some insights into what exactly is Enterprise Architecture

An enterprise is a collection of Organisations with some Shared Objectives, They have diverse functions, yet *some shared, unified goals*

The second term comes in Architecture.  It's a structure of components, their inter-relationships, the principles and guidelines that'll govern the design/evolution of our architectures

> TOGAF - isn't a monolithic manual, it's something more structured and phased out... this means it could either be used like a scaffolding, or maybe something that's pretty much tailored to your organisation's specific needs

This means it comprises everything from Fundamental Concepts (ADM, Enterprise continuum) (More on this subsequently) , to tools, frameworks, best practices , proven methodologies that have been trialed and tested . 

And why Enterprise Architecture? It provides us with a structured framework to manage complexities;      
Streamline operations and processes, maybe analyse and manage risks. Resource management or Stakeholder communication. 

At the end of the day, it's about ensuring we're strategically aligning technology with business objectives.

Now that we're through with the intro, let's dive deeper into individual sections :)
