# Insights into the TOGAF Framework

This space is dedicated to documenting my journey, as I explore enterprise architecture, specifically  The Open Group Architecture Framework - TOGAF.

As I dive deep into the principles & practices of TOGAF, this repository serves as both a learning guide and a resource for anyone interested in understanding enterprise architecture


## Breakdown:

   --> **Basics**: Fundamental Concepts plus TOGAF Key Objectives

   --> **ADM**: Deep-dive into Architecture Development Method plus its phases

   --> **Enterprise Continuum** & the Architecture Repository

   --> **Case Studies**: Practical examples and case studies on implementing TOGAF
   
   --> **Resources**:  Books, articles and websites I feel would be worthwhile for further reading and reference


## Setting the stage


Before we even explore TOGAF, I'll advise gaining some insights into what's Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise is a collection of Organisations with some Shared Objectives

While, what do you mean by Architecture? It's a structure of components , their inter-relationships, the principles and guidelines that'll govern the design/evolution of our architectures

TOGAF - isn't a monolithic manual, it's something more structured and phased out... this means it could either be used like a scaffolding, or maybe something that's pretty much tailored to your organisation's specific needs

This means it comprises everything from Fundamental Concepts (ADM, Enterprise continuum) (More on this subsequently) , to tools, best practices , methodologies that have been trialed and tested . 

Now that we're through with the intro, let's dive deeper into individual sections :)


   #### Disclaimer:

These notes and summaries have been captured during my preparation for the TOGAF Exam. They are intended to reflect my personal understanding and learning process. This repository is not meant to serve as an official guide or definitive source of information.
