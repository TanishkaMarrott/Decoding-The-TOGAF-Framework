   - Lack of disaster recovery capabilities
  
</br>

> (Requirements clarification. Gives us some hints on what the customer's looking for.)

</br>
 
**Our Solution:-**

--> Assessment + Planning :-

ðŸ“Œ (Crucial to understand the current state)

 - We went ahead with assessing the existing infrastructure
 - Next, planned the migration strategy --> The one *with minimal downtime.* 

</br>

**How did the Architecture design actually look like?**

We designed something massively scalable and secure. 

--> I always recommend utilizing the AWS Well-Architected Framework --> making sure we're keeping up with the best practices.
