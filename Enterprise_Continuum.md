# Enterprise Continuum

--> Core concept within TOGAF 

In simple words :-  "A categorisation Framework for artifacts & solutions"              
On the basis of:- varying levels of abstraction / specialisation
  
Comprises:

--> Architecture Continuum - Collection of Architectural Building Blocks. They're re-usable across projects

--> Solutions Continuum - Collection of the "actual implementations of the functionality that's been represented by the ABBs". These are the Solution Building Blocks (SBBS)

</br>

> Intangibles (ABBs) --> Something tangible (SBBs)

</br>

> Both strike a common note: They're a  "gradation" / A refinement of architectural elements --> Moving from Generic Architectures to something way more specific --> Organisation-specific elements. 

</br>

**Layers of the continuum:-**

Similar for both the continuums

1 --> Foundational :-  More like a Universal Scaffolding --> basic, fundamental building blocks that form a base for more specific structures --> DBMS, OS, netwroking services

2 --> Common Systems:- Building blocks that're reusable across multiple systems/ organisations --> Could be some common security frameworks, or shared middleware services

3 --> Industry-specific:- Address concerns of a specific industry like HCLS, BFSI

4 --> Organisation-specific:- Custom-built applications or  proprietary Business processes

</br>
 
**Architecture Repository** 

Serves as a storage & management system for all of our Architectural artifacts.

Key Components:- 

      - Meta-model:- This would be helpful in "defining the structure, the attributes & the relationships" of the artifacts.
      
      - Governance Log:- Or the Governance Repository. Tracks the governance decisions/ compliance
      
      - Standards Information Base:- Stores standards & guidelines
      
      - Reference Library:- Where you'd find reference models and patterns
      
      - Capability Assessment repository:- For storing capability assessments and maturity models


**Tools and techniques that're often used for managing the Enterprise Continuum:-**

--> Architecture modelling tools = For creating and visualising arch. models --> ArchiMate, UML 

--> Configuration management Tools = That could be for controlling versions + managing changes --> Jira

--> Content management systems = Wherein you could easily manage / access documents --> Sharepoint/ Drive

--> Collaboration tools = Collab. within the team --> Something like Slack, Confluence
