# Enterprise Capability - The Architecture Capability framework

 So, what exactly is "Architecture Capability"?

 Keeping it short & sweet --> The ability to develop, manage & maintain architecture (within an enterprise)

 What all does it comprise? -->  Organisational structures, roles & responsibilities; and how they fit in within an enterprise
 [while aligning with the overarching objectives]

</br>

> What benefit does it bring to the table? --> The "architecture practice" becomes  --> Well-managed, defined & aligned. üëç

</br>

**--> Key Aspects within this Framework:-**

- Organizational Structure:-

  Arrangement of --> Roles + responsibilities + their relationships in a hierarchy

   - Architecture Team -         
     Who actually develop and maintain the enterprise architecture
     
   - Architecture Board -            
     The governing body -->  Oversees the architectural implementation and if it aligns with the business.
     
   - Stakeholders -         
     That could refer to end-users, Business Leaders and Managers

</br>

- Roles and Responsibilities:-

   - Enterprise Architect -       
      He is the one who aligns the IT strategy with the business goals --> oversees governance and frameworks "across the org"
     
   - Chief Architect -      
      This is a more technically inclined role --> Defines + Implements high-level technical solutions
     
   - Domain architect -      
      He'd be handling the integrations AND interoperability of "domain-specific" architectures --> (Referring to BDAT)

   - Solution Architect -     
      SA typically designs "project-specific" solutions. He ensures compliance with EA.

> A quick clarification before we proceed     
> --> _"What exactly is the difference between a Chief Architect and an Enterprise Architect?_"
>
> Let me make things crystal-clear, before we actually proceed
>
> 1 --> An EA ensures that the IT strategy is very well-aligned with the overarching business objectives. His work is more around creating frameworks and standards, overseeing governance across all BUs.
>
>  Key terms to remember:- "oversee" and "across the org, all BUs"
>
> 2 --> CA is typically a "technical role". He would be defining & implementing high-level technical solutions, driving innovation --> across domains.

Processes ()

  - ADM :- The Architectural Development Model, Heart of TOGAF, Iterative model for designing, planning, implementing and Governing Enterprise Architecture
  - Architecture governance :- More around oversight of the implementation, ensuring the architecture practice conforms with architecture standards,  plus alignment with the business goals 
  - Stakeholder management , A very typical process --> involves managing the stakeholders, addressing their concerns, communicating plans plus ensuring their buy-in

- Tools and Techniques:-

  Since TOGAF is a structured framework, it provides us with a variety of tools and techniques that "facilitate" the development, management and documentation of architecture:-
     - Architecture Modelling tools --> Creating models and diagrams
     - Repository tools --> Storing and managing architectural artifacts
     - Collaboration tools --> Something like Confluence, for communication within the architecture team, and with the stakeholders

       
- Governance:-
    - We discussed this before. This is more around oversight of the implementation. This means it ensures that the practice operates effectively and ensures alignment with business strategy,
    - Plus, it would check for conformance/ compliance with regulatory standards
    - Managing , approving for changes to Enterprise Architecture.
    - So, two additional responsibilities :- Compliance Reviews plus Change Control
  
- Skills and Competencies

  - Architecture Skills frameworks outlines the skills/ competencies needed for a successful delivery of projects, So , this includes, identifying potential for upskilling/ development/ training  needed for a capable architecture team,    

  - This could either be :-
        - Analytical/ technical/ Communication skills               
        - Or could be some specialised skills:-            
              - understanding business processes/ goals/ strategies            
              - Defining data models, understanding data governence, management of data         
              - Design/ Integration of Applications            
              - Or could be proficiency in the Infrastructure Side of things (Technology Architecture)
